Predicting the promo effectiveness for DoDo Pizza


The task is to make the most personalized promo offer to the guest. What can be in the promo? For example, a 10% discount when ordering from 1000 rubles (euros, dollars) or a small pizza as a gift/with a discount. There are many options! The discount can also be offered as a percentage and in monetary units.

The goal is to learn how to predict whether a person will use a promo or ignore it. The more accurate the prediction, the more personalized offers the company can make to its customers.
